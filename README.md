# HTML5 Speedtest

No Flash, No Java, No Websocket, No Bullshit.

This is a very lightweight Speedtest implemented in Javascript, using XMLHttpRequest and Web Workers.

## Try it
[Take a Speedtest](http://speedtest.fdossena.com)

## Compatibility
Only modern browsers are supported (IE11, latest Edge, latest Chrome, latest Firefox, latest Safari)

## Requirements
 - A reasonably fast web server. PHP is optional but recommended (see doc.md for details)
 - Some way to generate garbage data (PHP script included, see doc.md for other solutions)
 - Your server must accept large POST requests (up to 20 Megabytes), otherwise the upload test will fail
 - It's also better if your server does not use compression, but it's not mandatory

## Quick installation videos
* [Debian 9.0 with Apache](https://fdossena.com/?p=speedtest/quickstart_deb.frag)
* [Windows Server 2016 with IIS](https://fdossena.com/?p=speedtest/quickstart_win.frag)
